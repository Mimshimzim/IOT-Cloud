## IoT Project: RFID-Based Access Control System using AWS IoT Core

## Introduction
This IoT project aims to build an access control system using an MFRC522 RFID module, an AWS IoT Core platform, and an LED for visual feedback. The system will read RFID tags using the MFRC522 module, publish the tag ID to an AWS IoT Core topic using the MQTT publish function, and subscribe to AWS IoT Core topic to receive tag IDs and control an LED accordingly.

Sure! Let's modify the hardware setup and some of the software aspects to use a Raspberry Pi Pico with MicroPython instead of a Raspberry Pi for this IoT project.

## Components Required
- Raspberry Pi Pico with MicroPython firmware
- MFRC522 RFID module
- LED (with appropriate resistor)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Internet connection for the Raspberry Pi Pico
- AWS IoT Core account

## Hardware Setup
1. Connect the MFRC522 RFID module to the Raspberry Pi Pico using jumper wires. Make sure to connect the necessary power (3.3V and GND) and SPI pins (GP2 - SDA, GP3 - SCK, GP4 - MOSI, GP5 - MISO, GP6 - RST, GP7 - CS) between the module and Raspberry Pi Pico.

2. Connect an LED to the Raspberry Pi Pico. Connect the positive (anode) leg of the LED to a GPIO pin (e.g., GP8) and the negative (cathode) leg to a current-limiting resistor, and then connect the other end of the resistor to the GND pin.

3. Ensure that your Raspberry Pi Pico is connected to a computer with MicroPython installed and ready to be programmed.

## Software Setup
1. Install necessary libraries:
   - The `mfrc522` library is typically available for MicroPython as well. You may need to install it to interface with the RFID module.
   - The `umqtt.simple` library for MQTT communication is available for MicroPython. Install it to interact with AWS IoT Core.

2. Create an AWS IoT Core Thing:
   - Log in to your AWS IoT Core console and create a new Thing representing your Raspberry Pi Pico device.

3. Set up MQTT communication:
   - Create an AWS IoT Core topic to which the Raspberry Pi Pico will publish RFID tag IDs.
   - Create another topic to which the Raspberry Pi Pico will subscribe to receive commands to turn on or off the LED.

4. Update AWS credentials:
   - On your Raspberry Pi Pico, configure the AWS SDK with appropriate access credentials to allow the device to communicate with AWS IoT Core securely.

## Implementation
The implementation remains the same as mentioned earlier, except for the necessary changes to work with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico. Initialize the MFRC522 module, set up GPIO pins for the LED and SPI communication, and implement RFID reading, publishing, and LED control functionalities as described before.

## Workflow
The workflow also remains the same, with the Raspberry Pi Pico performing RFID scanning, AWS IoT Core communication, and LED control based on the received RFID tag ID.

## Conclusion
By using a Raspberry Pi Pico with MicroPython, you can achieve similar functionality as with a Raspberry Pi while working with a smaller and more cost-effective microcontroller. This IoT project demonstrates how to create an RFID-based access control system using AWS IoT Core, and you can expand upon this foundation for various applications that require RFID tag authentication and control functionalities.
